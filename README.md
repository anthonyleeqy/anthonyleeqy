Hello world ðŸ‘‹,

My name is Anthony. I am passionate about exploring data, telling stories, drawing insights and forming strategies from abstract numbers. I am also a certified AWS machine learning specialist. 

My current job involves:<br/> 
â€¢ Revenue forecast and resource optimization for data-driven corporate strategy.<br/> 
â€¢ Customer behavior study for product pricing strategy.<br/> 
â€¢ Product growth prediction for business development.<br/>

Besides my work, I created my own algorithmic cryptocurrency trading robot (Josh, visit him in my repositoryðŸ˜€), and he helped me earn some $$. ðŸ¤–
