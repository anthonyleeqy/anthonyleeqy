Hello world ğŸ‘‹,

I am Anthony. I am passionate about exploring data, telling stories, drawing insights and form strategies from abstract numbers.

My current job involves: 
â€¢Revenue forecast and resource optimization for data-driven corporate strategy. 
â€¢Customer behavior study to adjust our pricing strategy. 
â€¢Product growth prediction for business development.

Besides my work, I created my own crypto-trading robot (Josh), and he helped me earn some $$. ğŸ¤–
