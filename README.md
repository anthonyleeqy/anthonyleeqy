Hello world ðŸ‘‹,

My name is Anthony. I am passionate about exploring data, telling stories, drawing insights, and forming strategies from abstract numbers. I am also a certified AWS machine learning specialist and a certified TensorFlow Developer. 

My current job involves:<br/> 
â€¢ Using large language models to understand the business environment and optimize business directions.<br/> 
â€¢ Performing Revenue forecast and resource optimization for data-driven corporate strategy.<br/> 
â€¢ Studying customer behavior for product pricing strategy.<br/> 
â€¢ Predicting product growth for business development.<br/>

Besides my work, I created and deployed my own live crypto-trading robot (Josh, visit him in my repositoryðŸ˜€), and he helped me earn some $$. ðŸ¤–
